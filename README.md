Peach-Dungeon-Escape
====================
This is a GBA game programmed in C for CS 2110.

You, Princess Peach, are trapped in a dungeon... again. And Mario is on his way to save you... again. But this time, you're sick of waiting around while Mario has all the fun. You swiped the keys off the guard and now have to find your way out of the dungeon!

There are 5 rooms in the dungeon, each with 3 doors. There is only one exit out of the whole dungeon, the last door in room 5. All the other doors link between the rooms.

Use LEFT and RIGHT to move.
Use  UP to enter a door.
